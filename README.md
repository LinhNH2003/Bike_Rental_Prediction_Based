# Bike Rentals Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting bike rentals using a linear modeling approach. The dataset contains information about regional bike rental trends, and the model aims to provide accurate predictions of the number of bikes rented based on various factors.

Key steps in the project include:

1. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Conducted thorough exploration of the dataset to uncover trends and relationships in the data. 
   - Applied statistical techniques to understand the significance of different variables in predicting bike rentals.

2. **Linear Model Implementation**: 
   - Built a linear regression model to predict bike rentals based on input features.
   - Performed transformations on raw data to optimize model performance and ensure it adheres to the assumptions of linear regression.

3. **Model Diagnostics**:
   - Checked for linearity and verified model assumptions using residual plots and other diagnostic tools.
   - Extended the base linear model by iterating on the initial model, applying improvements based on insights gathered during the analysis.

## Files in this Repository

- `final_project.Rmd`: Contains the detailed R code used for the analysis and model building process, as well as explanations and results.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, the process followed, and the contents of the repository.

## Requirements

To run the analysis and build the model, the following tools are required:
- **R**: Version 4.0 or higher
- **RStudio** (optional but recommended for easy viewing of `.Rmd` files)
- **Packages**: 
  - `ggplot2` (for data visualization)
  - `dplyr` (for data manipulation)
  - `stats` (for statistical analysis)
  
## Model Performance
The linear model achieved satisfactory performance based on:

  - Analysis of residuals.
  - Testing on unseen data to evaluate its predictive power.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of linear modeling techniques to predict bike rentals. By conducting comprehensive data analysis, refining the model, and validating its assumptions, we were able to build a robust predictor of bike rental demand.
